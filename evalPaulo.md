## HW3 Evaluation - Paulo Lemus - Team Sandwich

## 1) What I learned from this homework:

I spent the first 8 hours working on adding the GoogleTest dependancy,
as well as setting up the makefile and make environment.
From this, I learned how to add dependencies to a project so that
anyone who has it does not need to install an external library.
