# Task 3

For the final project, our group is planning on doing the Facebook project.
We are deciding between doing this project or doing the Autocomplete project,
but we may go with Facebook because we can incorperate Autocomplete inside of it.

We are thinking about doing Facebook because we think that is will both be a 
challenge and be very fun to make. With time permitting, we are planning on
experimenting with a GUI framework like Qt or GTK+ to see if it would be possible
to integrate the logic code with a GUI. We are also thinking about writing it
in a server client fashion, so that multiple users can connect the server at one
time. The great part is that we can scale the project up or down depending on 
the difficulty or how realistic our goals are, so that we should have a decent
final project in any case.
