## HW3 Evaluation - Matt Yamamoto - Team Sandwich


## 1) What I learned from this homework:
	Through this homework I learned how to implements lists as stacks
through the extra credit part and how to implement arrays as queues in the
router part. I learned about using ctime and practiced with RNG. I practiced
parsing and filtering out unnecessary elements.

## 2) My Contributions
	I contributed to the extra credit problem by doing the hand calculations
and formulating the process. I was working on a seperate version of the
reverse polish calculator but we ended up using the current version. I made
some changes to the queue class for it to work with the RPC. Besides
that I didn't contribute much to the homework assignment.

## 3) Questions:
	Can we discuss workflow for a team thats working on the same piece
of code. How does a team in a professional environment collaborate, I tend
to want to write the whole program so I know whats going on.
